### Welcome to the Seta Workshop Empty API

First of all, thanks a lot for taking the time to do this, we really appreciate it! ðŸ™‚

For your first PR we will ask you to do the following:

- Configure the database (it doesn't matter which one)

- Create the necessary structures (tables, models, classes, etc) to support projects, with their name, technologies in which are being developed, and when they started, and users which work on them (the user attributes is up to you decide what you want them to have).

- Create a controller to allow the creation of a project and to get them all (including their users). **If you have worked with jobs previously** please move the creation code into a job, remove it from the controller. In other words, invoke the job from the controller and return the result.

- Test **some of the things** that you implemented. Here it doesn't matter what is used to test, and all gems you want to help you can be added to the project.

- Push the code and create a pull request (or merge request if Gitlab)

**NOTE: Bear in mind that there is no right or wrong way to do this (if the concepts are in place and there is a proper justification)**

**NOTE 2: This API responds in JSON format, so the controller actions should return a JSON**

**MOST OF THE DECISIONS ARE UP TO YOU, EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO ADD, IMPROVE, OR CHANGE IS ALLOWED, JUST SHOW OFF WHAT YOU KNOW!**

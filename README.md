### Welcome to the Seta Workshop Empty API

First of all, thanks a lot for taking the time to do this, we really appreciate it! ðŸ™‚

For your first PR we will ask you to do the following:

- Configure the database (it doesn't matter which one)

- Create the necessary structures (tables, models, classes, etc) to support projects, with their name, technologies in which are being developed, and when they started.

- Create a controller to allow the creation of a project and to get them all. The creation code must be held in a job, not in the controller itself.

- Test some of the things that were implemented. Here it doesn't matter what is used to test, and all gems you want to help you can be added to the project.

- Push the code and create a pull request (or merge request if in Gitlab)

**NOTE: Bear in mind that there is no right or wrong way to do this (if the concepts are in place and there is a proper justification)**
